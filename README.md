# Coffee-Machine
 A coffee machine that allows users to buy coffee and allows the owner of the coffee machine to maintain it.

Users have three types of coffee they can buy:
    espresso, latte, cappuccino

When they choose a drink by typing in the name of the drink, the coffee machine will prompt them
to pay for it, if the coffee machine has enough resources to make the coffee.

The user can pay using coins:
    quarters ($0.25), dimes ($0.10), nickels ($0.05), pennies ($0.01)

If the user enters enough of each coin, the coffee machine will give change if necessary and
'serve' the drink. Else, it will refund the money.

Admin commands:
    Type "report" to see the resources that the coffee machine currently has.
    Type "off" to turn the coffee machine off.
